## Technologies used ##

To develop Project the author use the following basic web technologies:

* HTML,
* CSS,
* Javascript on jQuery library basis. To realize my idea I use two Javascript files with code.
First, downloaded, installed and modified Plugin called jquery.pagepilling.js from 
https://github.com/alvarotrigo/pagePiling.js/. Second file developed by myself.
* https://wireframe.cc/ to create wireframe online
