## Milestone Project 2 ##

### Website for my hobby ###

### Introduction ###

The photography is my hobby. I shoot photos with smartphone or Canon DSLR camera. 
In this Project I try to develop the website for my personal needs or hobby. 
It is a website for Photographer.

### UX ###

Project wireframe you could find in directory Assets.
In the photo industry, itâ€™s usually good practice to have your own site on the site.

That is why:

* As an owner of the web resource I want to represent my skills as a Photographer to everybody;
* Also as an owner of this wesite I want to provide my contact information, that everybody could communicate 
with me;
* As an user I would like to find information about photo session price;
* As an owner I would like to represent my biography and professional skills.

### Technologies used ###

To develop Project the author use the following basic web technologies:

* HTML,
* CSS,
* Javascript on jQuery library basis. To realize my idea I have implemented two Javascript files with code.
First, downloaded, installed and modified Plugin called jquery.pagepilling.js from 
https://github.com/alvarotrigo/pagePiling.js/. Second file developed by myself script.js.
* https://wireframe.cc/ to create wireframe online
